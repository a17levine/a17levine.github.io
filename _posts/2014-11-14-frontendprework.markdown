# Setting the scene for a beginner's web development class

This document and its included exercises are used to ramp up beginners into becoming ready for a 10-week web development evening class.

Many of the students are brand new to web development. Originally the prework was a list of exercises without much context about why we were learning these topics.

With this document, I explain in plain English how these technologies are related and why they are important to learn.

As a result, students had much more perspective by Day 1 of class.
