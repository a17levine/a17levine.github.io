I had a floormate in college who took a shower in about 3-4 minutes. "My dad told me that he paid for the water and I had to use as little as possible", he would explain. 

As he got ready for his shower, he'd get the loofah soaped up before any water started. I think he even covered himself with soap and turned on the water twice, once for the soap to build lather and the second time to rinse off what he'd applied to himself.

For me, this was insane. The shower had been some kind of spa treatment for me, a sort of extended hot tub session where I'd rehash thoughts, come up with songs, replay memories of the day and sometimes talk the dialog of a conversation I had earlier. Honestly, I was embarrassed. I had been made aware of my privilege with such a simple daily activity. I was taking Hollywood showers my whole life.

Now that I'm a grown-up, pay my own water bills and live in a drought ridden area I've paid special attention to water consumption.

## The Navy Shower

I'd later learn about the [Navy shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_shower) which was essentially the same thing as what my floormate did.

When you're on a ship, there is a scarce supply of fresh water so showering must be efficient. A Navy shower could use as little as 3 liters of water while a Hollywood shower could use as much as 280 liters.

### How to take a Navy Shower

1. Wet yourself (water on, minimal time)
2. Add water to soap (water on, minimal time)
3. Cover yourself with soap (water off, max time)
3. Rinse (water on, minimal time)

## The Indian Bucket Shower

Earlier this year when I was in India, I was introduced to the [Indian Bucket Shower](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/07/25/335250270/our-india-correspondent-cant-kick-the-bucket-bathing-habit). Inside one large bucket there is a measuring cup sized pitcher. You essentially ladle water over yourself until you're done and you are much more conscious of how much water you're using.

Cheap traditional guest houses had this setup and probably most households. 

The washing process is the same as the Navy Shower.

## How could I achieve this at home?

I became comfortable with this style of showering. It feels very respectful and efficient. Also it solves the problem of the fogged up mirror when you're trying to shave after a shower.

The problem for me was the hot/cold mix. I'd love to turn off my shower stream but if I didn't have the proper hot/cold mix, it would just be too much of a pain. I thought there must be a valve you could put in between the shower head and the pipe that would allow you to cut off the flow but preserve the mix.

Sure enough people on Amazon thought the same.

## The shower valve

Could this revolutionize the shower? Why wouldn't I just toggle the shower head valve instead of messing with the hot/cold dials since I could always get the mix I liked?

Turns out that at least with showers that have the bathtub spigot, water leaked out of that so my dream was crushed, but during a shower the valve was as effective as I anticipated. It did the job.

### Installing a shower valve

1. Buy the valve
2. Buy plumber tape
3. Find/buy a wrench
4. Watch this video and do what he says

The only tricky part was getting enough plumbers tape on in order for the nozzle not to leak once the valve was cutting off the water. I got it on the 3rd or 4th time.

## Quantifying the result

I've been showering with the valve for months now and have been very happy with it. However I wanted to go a step further and quantify the water savings.
