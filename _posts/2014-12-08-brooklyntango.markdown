# A captivating landing page for a tango studio

Tango has been my latest obsession taking classes several times a week and watching YouTube instructionals in the time in-between.

The founder of brooklyntango, Ney Melo, asked me to make a landing page for him. He asked for an image of the NYC skyline as the background. I wanted it to have more to do with tango but not the corny tropes that seem way too dramatic and sultry where the dance is much more subtle.

Instead, I thought a video background would be perfect as watching tango being danced is often what draws people, especially myself, into committing to taking lessons.

For responsive, I took a screenshot from the video and made the info box full viewport.

The JQuery plugin [Tubular](http://www.seanmccambridge.com/tubular/) made it dead-simple to make the video background and have it all stream from YouTube. Deployed to GitHub pages for free, all Ney needed to do was buy the domain.
