# Automating 1-on-1 meeting planning

My final project for the MakerSquare Immersive course was Blocktalk, a way to automate the tedious logistics of finding a time to talk.

The way this happens now is someone says 'lets chat!' and then sends you times they're free. You reply with a time that works, then someone makes a calendar invite. There can be a lot of emailing back and fourth before a time is figured out.

With Blocktalk, one person sends when they can talk to someone else. The recipient chooses which time works for a discussion. They both receive calendar invites. For the initiating user, they are given a unique link to share with the recipient. No logins are needed.
