The day finally came that my mom asked Eric and I to clean out our childhood home. She wants to prepare the house for sale which can only mean sell/donate everything that isn't nailed down and back up all of the photos/videos that we care to keep.

## Disposing of things that no longer served me was hugely cathartic

I knew that there was very little value in the contents of my desk and dresser drawers but seeing them empty was an awesome feeling. 

The speed at which I disposed of the items in my room was also surprising to me. It might come with getting older and being more realistic about when I'd actually need an item in the future but I found it very easy to dispose of much of what I had already been living without.

## Sorting through the junk

**Tools utilized:** Trash bags, Post-It notes, markers for Post-It notes

Everything I found fit into one of these categories. Its a good idea to figure out space to put these ahead of time. We put them in the garage in different areas.

1. Trash / recycle
2. E-waste (electronics that should be mined of their heavy metals before landfill)
3. Donations
4. Craigslist items
5. Garage sale nick nacks
6. Ebay items
7. Artifacts that trigger memories (photos, videos, trophies, certificates, gifts...)
8. Things that could be useful to any household (pens, notebooks, tape)

## Scanning 9,000+ family photos and documents

I thought initially that sending our photos away to a scanning service would be more cost-effective. Those services probably had fancy scanners and automation on their side, right?

If we had done that, we would've spent over $5,000. Photo scanning services are expensive. Prices they charge range from about $0.50 - $0.60 per photo.

Research led us to buying the feed-loadng Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 which we got refurb for $300 on eBay. For the same cost of 500 photos (with a scanning service), we were able to scan more than 9,000. In addition, if your only use of this scanner is a one-time family photo digitization, you probably could probably sell the same unit on eBay when your done and have your total cost be closer to $30-$40 for the scanner.

## Organizing is the most labor-intensive task of photo scanning

As Eric and I scanned piles of random photos, we quickly realized that sorting the images on the computer was really annoying and difficult. We wanted to grab a pile of photos, scan, and drop into a folder labeled with that topic. 

Switching gears we created notes on the floor for each topic "Florida Vacations", "Grampas House in Staten Island", "Mom and Dad" and stacked photos related to those topics on the notes. We still kept it vague so we weren't driven crazy by a complex categorization.

Then Eric, Mom, and I all sat on the floor and started stacking our photos into categories (all the while sharing stories). We returned to scanning a few days later with a much easier task now that the pictures were somewhat coherent.

## Scanners must be cleaned or else they mess up your photos

We had never cleaned a feed-loading scanner before but vertical lines started to appear on our scans and we had no choice. Vertical lines are created by debris on the scanner which become a line on scanned photos because the photos pass underneath the debris.

The Fujitsu needs the F1 solution which fortunately can be found in individually-wrapped wipes for less than $20 on Amazon. We also used a microfiber cloth to dry the solution and help get the debris off the glass which was stubborn sometimes.

## Ebay now suggests your item and a price for it
