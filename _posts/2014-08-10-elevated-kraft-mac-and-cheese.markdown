I've been trying to elevate Kraft Mac and Cheese for a long time now and I think I finally nailed it. Winning formula being equal parts fresh chives and fresh thyme, mixed in with some heavy shakes of red pepper flake to taste and served alongside spinach.

After you dump the cooked noodles into the colander, melt enough butter to match the amount of cheese powder. Once melted, stir in cheese powder to form a ghetto roux, then mix in 2% milk and whisk in the clumps. Add milk with heat until the sauce is the right consistency.

Add about 1.5 Tbsp of an equal part mix of fresh thyme and fresh chives, red pepper flake to taste and serve alongside spinach and a glass of 2% milk.
