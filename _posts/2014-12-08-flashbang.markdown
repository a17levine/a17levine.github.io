# Beating CraigsList with simplicity and style

The most complex project I am working on is still in the works.

The idea is to make peer to peer commerce easier and simpler. Most tasks that are done via email on CraigsList can be made much more convenient with help from an app. That's what Flashbang aims to solve. Simpler posting, simpler trading, more engagement from passive buyers.
