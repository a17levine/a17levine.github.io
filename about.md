Currently in Austin, TX. My current mission is to build great web applications and cook great food. 

Teamed up with Marcus Carey at vThreat Inc., we're building innovative ways for companies to prepare for cyber attacks. 

I am also the co-founder and editor of Austin Departures, a travel publication for Austin-area travelers.
