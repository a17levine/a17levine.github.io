title: About Alex 
---


I'm a Massachusetts native now living in Austin, Texas. I am a product-centric web developer. My current mission is to build great web applications and cook great food. 

Currently, I'm up with Marcus Carey at <a href="https://www.vthreat.com/" target="_blank">vThreat</a>. We're building innovative ways for companies to prepare for internet attacks. 

I am also the co-founder and editor of Austin Departures, a travel publication for Austin-area travelers.
