I'm an Andover, Massachusetts native now living in Austin, Texas. I am a product-centric web developer. My current mission is to build great web applications and cook awesome food. 

Currently, I'm up Lead Developer at <a href="https://www.vthreat.com/" target="_blank">vThreat</a>. We're building innovative ways for companies to prepare for web-based attacks.
