I'm an Andover, Massachusetts native now living in Austin, Texas. My current mission is to build great web applications and cook awesome food. 

Currently, I'm the Lead Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ticketbud.com/" target="_blank">Ticketbud</a>. We're giving event organizers, like you, a cost-effective way to charge admission fees and get daily payouts to fund your event.
